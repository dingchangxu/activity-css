<p>A baby chameleon hatches from an egg after being guarded by its mum deep down in their burrow. Photographer Francisco Mingorance worked with chameleons for 15 years before he was able to capture the special moment. The breeding female dug a 70cm-deep tunnel in the soil to create a small vault where she laid her eggs in Almunecar, near Malaga, Spain. Around a year later, the eggs hatched, and Francisco caught the magic moment. Francisco says: "Just minutes after the small chameleons hatched, they left the den by the same tunnel that their mother dug a year earlier. Once in the open they camouflaged themselves in the vegetation."</p>
