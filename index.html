    <h3>baby chameleon, <em>Malaga, Spain December 12 2011</em></h3>

<p>A baby chameleon hatches from an egg after being guarded by its mum deep down in their burrow. Photographer <em>Francisco Mingorance</em> worked with chameleons for 15 years before he was able to capture the special moment. The breeding female dug a <em>70cm-deep</em> tunnel in the soil to create a small vault where she laid her eggs in <em>Almunecar, near Malaga, Spain.</em> Around a year later, the eggs hatched, and Francisco caught the magic moment. Francisco says: <em>"Just minutes after the small chameleons hatched, they left the den by the same tunnel that their mother dug a year earlier. Once in the open they camouflaged themselves in the vegetation."</em></p>
